UNICHARSET_EXTRACTOR(1)
=======================

NAME
----
unicharset_extractor - extract unicharset from Tesseract boxfiles

SYNOPSIS
--------
*unicharset_extractor* '[-D dir]' 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Tesseract needs to know the set of possible characters it can output. 
To generate the unicharset data file, use the unicharset_extractor 
program on the same training pages bounding box files as used for 
clustering:

    unicharset_extractor fontfile_1.box fontfile_2.box ...

The unicharset will be put into the file 'dir/unicharset', or simply
'./unicharset' if no output directory is provided.

Tesseract also needs to have access to character properties isalpha, 
isdigit, isupper, islower, ispunctuation. all of this auxilury data 
and more is encoded in this file. (See unicharset(5))

If your system supports the wctype functions, these values will be set 
automatically by unicharset_extractor and there is no need to edit the 
unicharset file. On some older systems (eg Windows 95), the unicharset 
file must be edited by hand to add these property description codes.

*NOTE* The unicharset file must be regenerated whenever inttemp, normproto 
and pffmtable are generated (i.e. they must all be recreated when the box 
file is changed) as they have to be in sync. This is made easier than in 
previous versions by running unicharset_extractor before mftraining and 
cntraining, and giving the unicharset to mftraining.
