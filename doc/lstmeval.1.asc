NAME
----
lstmeval - Evaluation program for LSTM-based networks.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*lstmeval* --model 'lang.lstm|langtrain_checkpoint|pluscharsN.NNN_NN.checkpoint' [--traineddata lang/lang.traineddata] --eval_listfile 'lang.eval_files.txt' [--verbosity N] [--max_image_MB NNNN]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
lstmeval(1) evaluates LSTM-based networks. Either a recognition model or a training checkpoint can be given as input for evaluation along with a list of lstmf files. If evaluating a training checkpoint, '--traineddata' should also be specified.

OPTIONS
-------
'--model  FILE'::
  Name of model file (training or recognition)  (type:string default:)

'--traineddata  FILE'::
  If model is a training checkpoint, then traineddata must be the traineddata file that was given to the trainer  (type:string default:)

'--eval_listfile  FILE'::
  File listing sample files in lstmf training format.  (type:string default:)

'--max_image_MB  INT'::
  Max memory to use for images.  (type:int default:2000)

'--verbosity  INT'::
  Amount of diagnosting information to output (0-2).  (type:int default:1)

HISTORY
-------
lstmeval(1) was first made available for tesseract4.00.00alpha.
