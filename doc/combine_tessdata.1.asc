COMBINE_TESSDATA(1)
===================

NAME
----
combine_tessdata - combine/extract/overwrite Tesseract data

SYNOPSIS
--------
*combine_tessdata* ['OPTION'] 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
combine_tessdata(1) is the main program to combine/extract/overwrite 
tessdata components in [lang].traineddata files.

To combine all the individual tessdata components (unicharset, DAWGs,
classifier templates, ambiguities, language configs) located at, say,
/home/$USER/temp/eng.* run:

  combine_tessdata /home/$USER/temp/eng.

The result will be a combined tessdata file /home/$USER/temp/eng.traineddata

Specify option -e if you would like to extract individual components
from a combined traineddata file. For example, to extract language config
file and the unicharset from tessdata/eng.traineddata run:

  combine_tessdata -e tessdata/eng.traineddata \
    /home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharset

The desired config file and unicharset will be written to
/home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharset

Specify option -o to overwrite individual components of the given
[lang].traineddata file. For example, to overwrite language config
and unichar ambiguities files in tessdata/eng.traineddata use:

  combine_tessdata -o tessdata/eng.traineddata \
    /home/$USER/temp/eng.config /home/$USER/temp/eng.unicharambigs

As a result, tessdata/eng.traineddata will contain the new language config
and unichar ambigs, plus all the original DAWGs, classifier templates, etc.

Note: the file names of the files to extract to and to overwrite from should
have the appropriate file suffixes (extensions) indicating their tessdata
component type (.unicharset for the unicharset, .unicharambigs for unichar
ambigs, etc). See k*FileSuffix variable in ccutil/tessdatamanager.h.

Specify option -u to unpack all the components to the specified path:

    combine_tessdata -u tessdata/eng.traineddata /home/$USER/temp/eng.

This will create  /home/$USER/temp/eng.* files with individual tessdata
components from tessdata/eng.traineddata.

OPTIONS
-------
*-e* '.traineddata' 'FILE'...:
    Extracts the specified components from the .traineddata file

*-o* '.traineddata' 'FILE'...:
    Overwrites the specified components of the .traineddata file
    with those provided on the comand line.

*-u* '.traineddata' 'PATHPREFIX'
    Unpacks the .traineddata using the provided prefix.

CAVEATS
-------
'Prefix' refers to the full file prefix, including period (.)


COMPONENTS
----------
The components in a Tesseract lang.traineddata file as of
Tesseract 3.02 are briefly described below; For more information on
many of these files, see
<http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3>

lang.config::
  (Optional) Language-specific overrides to default config variables.

lang.unicharset::
  (Required) The list of symbols that Tesseract recognizes, with properties.
  See unicharset(5).

lang.unicharambigs::
  (Optional) This file contains information on pairs of recognized symbols
  which are often confused.  For example, 'rn' and 'm'.

lang.inttemp::
  (Required) Character shape templates for each unichar.  Produced by
  mftraining(1).

lang.pffmtable::
  (Required) The number of features expected for each unichar.
  Produced by mftraining(1) from *.tr* files.

lang.normproto::
  (Required) Character normalization prototypes generated by cntraining(1)
  from *.tr* files.

lang.punc-dawg::
  (Optional) A dawg made from punctuation patterns found around words.
  The "word" part is replaced by a single space.

lang.word-dawg::
  (Optional) A dawg made from dictionary words from the language.

lang.number-dawg::
  (Optional) A dawg made from tokens which originally contained digits.
  Each digit is replaced by a space character.

lang.freq-dawg::
  (Optional) A dawg made from the most frequent words which would have
  gone into word-dawg.

lang.fixed-length-dawgs::
  (Optional) Several dawgs of different fixed lengths -- useful for
  languages like Chinese.

lang.cube-unicharset::
  (Optional) A unicharset for cube, if cube was trained on a different set
  of symbols.

lang.cube-word-dawg::
  (Optional) A word dawg for cube's alternate unicharset.  Not needed if Cube
  was trained with Tesseract's unicharset.

lang.shapetable::
  (Optional) When present, a shapetable is an extra layer between the character
  classifier and the word recognizer that allows the character classifier to
  return a collection of unichar ids and fonts instead of a single unichar-id
  and font.

lang.bigram-dawg::
  (Optional) A dawg of word bigrams where the words are separated by a space
  and each digit is replaced by a '?'.

lang.unambig-dawg::
  (Optional) TODO: Describe.

lang.params-training-model::
  (Optional) TODO: Describe.
