NAME
----
shapeclustering - shape clustering training for Tesseract

SYNOPSIS
--------
shapeclustering -D 'output_dir'
    -U 'unicharset' -O 'mfunicharset'
    -F 'font_props' -X 'xheights'
    'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
shapeclustering(1) takes extracted feature .tr files (generated by
tesseract(1) run in a special mode from box files) and produces a
file *shapetable* and an enhanced unicharset.  This program is still
experimental, and is not required (yet) for training Tesseract.

OPTIONS
-------
-U 'FILE'::
	The unicharset generated by unicharset_extractor(1).

-D 'dir'::
	Directory to write output files to.

-F 'font_properties_file'::
	(Input) font properties file, where each line is of the following form, where each field other than the font name is 0 or 1:

	'font_name' 'italic' 'bold' 'fixed_pitch' 'serif' 'fraktur'

-X 'xheights_file'::
	(Input) x heights file, each line is of the following form, where xheight is calculated as the pixel x height of a character drawn at 32pt on 300 dpi. [ That is, if base x height + ascenders + descenders = 133, how much is x height? ]

	'font_name' 'xheight'

-O 'FILE'::
	The output unicharset that will be given to combine_tessdata(1).
