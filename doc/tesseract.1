.sp
To use a non\-standard language pack named \fBfoo\&.traineddata\fR, set the \fBTESSDATA_PREFIX\fR environment variable so the file can be found at \fBTESSDATA_PREFIX\fR/tessdata/\fBfoo\fR\&.traineddata and give Tesseract the argument \fI\-l foo\fR\&.
.SH "CONFIG FILES AND AUGMENTING WITH USER DATA"
.sp
Tesseract config files consist of lines with variable\-value pairs (space separated)\&. The variables are documented as flags in the source code like the following one in tesseractclass\&.h:
.sp
STRING_VAR_H(tessedit_char_blacklist, "", "Blacklist of chars not to recognize");
.sp
These variables may enable or disable various features of the engine, and may cause it to load (or not load) various data\&. For instance, let\(cqs suppose you want to OCR in English, but suppress the normal dictionary and load an alternative word list and an alternative list of patterns \(em these two files are the most commonly used extra data files\&.
.sp
If your language pack is in /path/to/eng\&.traineddata and the hocr config is in /path/to/configs/hocr then create three new files:
.sp
/path/to/eng\&.user\-words:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
the
quick
brown
fox
jumped
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
/path/to/eng\&.user\-patterns:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
1\-\ed\ed\ed\-GOOG\-411
www\&.\en\e\e\e*\&.com
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
/path/to/configs/bazaar:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
load_system_dawg     F
load_freq_dawg       F
user_words_suffix    user\-words
user_patterns_suffix user\-patterns
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Now, if you pass the word \fIbazaar\fR as a trailing command line parameter to Tesseract, Tesseract will not bother loading the system dictionary nor the dictionary of frequent words and will load and use the eng\&.user\-words and eng\&.user\-patterns files you provided\&. The former is a simple word list, one per line\&. The format of the latter is documented in dict/trie\&.h on read_pattern_list()\&.
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
The engine was developed at Hewlett Packard Laboratories Bristol and at Hewlett Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998\&. A lot of the code was written in C, and then some more was written in C++\&. The C\e++ code makes heavy use of a list system using macros\&. This predates stl, was portable before stl, and is more efficient than stl lists, but has the big negative that if you do get a segmentation violation, it is hard to debug\&.
.sp
Version 2\&.00 brought Unicode (UTF\-8) support, six languages, and the ability to train Tesseract\&.
.sp
Tesseract was included in UNLV\(cqs Fourth Annual Test of OCR Accuracy\&. See \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/tesseract\-ocr/docs/blob/master/AT\-1995\&.pdf\fR\m[]\&. With Tesseract 2\&.00, scripts are now included to allow anyone to reproduce some of these tests\&. See \m[blue]\fBhttps://github\&.com/tesseract\-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TestingTesseract\fR\m[] for more details\&.
.sp
Tesseract 3\&.00 adds a number of new languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean\&. It also introduces a new, single\-file based system of managing language data\&.
.sp
Tesseract 3\&.02 adds BiDirectional text support, the ability to recognize multiple languages in a single image, and improved layout analysis\&.
.sp
For further details, see the file ReleaseNotes included with the distribution\&.
