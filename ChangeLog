2010-11-29 - V3.01
  * Removed old/dead serialise/deserialze methods on *LISTIZED classes.
  * Total rewrite of DENORM to better encapsulate operation and make
    for potential to extract features from images.
  * Thread-safety! Moved all critical globals and statics to members of the appropriate class. Tesseract is now thread-safe (multiple instances can be used in parallel in multiple threads.) with the minor exception that some control parameters are still global and affect all threads.
  * Added Cube, a new recognizer for Arabic. Cube can also be used in combination with normal Tesseract for other languages with an improvement in accuracy at the cost of (much) lower speed. *There is no training module for Cube yet.*
  * `OcrEngineMode` in `Init` replaces `AccuracyVSpeed` to control cube.
  * Greatly improved segmentation search with consequent accuracy and speed improvements, especially for Chinese.
  * Added `PageIterator` and `ResultIterator` as cleaner ways to get the full results out of Tesseract, that are not currently provided by any of the `TessBaseAPI::Get*` methods. All other methods, such as the `ETEXT_STRUCT` in particular are deprecated and will be deleted in the future.
  * ApplyBoxes totally rewritten to make training easier. It can now cope with touching/overlapping training characters, and a new boxfile format allows word boxes instead of character boxes, BUT to use that you have to have already boostrapped the language with character boxes. "Cyclic dependency" on traineddata.
  * Auto orientation and script detection added to page layout analysis.
  * Deleted *lots* of dead code.
  * Fixxht module replaced with scalable data-driven module.
  * Output font characteristics accuracy improved.
