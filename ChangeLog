2012-02-01 - v3.02
  * Moved ResultIterator/PageIterator to ccmain.
  * Added Right-to-left/Bidi capability in the output iterators for Hebrew/Arabic.
  * Added paragraph detection in layout analysis/post OCR.
  * Fixed inconsistent xheight during training and over-chopping.
  * Added simultaneous multi-language capability.
  * Refactored top-level word recognition module.
  * Added experimental equation detector.
  * Improved handling of resolution from input images.
  * Blamer module added for error analysis.
  * Cleaned up externally used namespace by removing includes from baseapi.h.
  * Removed dead memory mangagement code.
  * Tidied up constraints on control parameters.
  * Added support for ShapeTable in classifier and training.
  * Refactored class pruner.
  * Fixed training leaks and randomness.
  * Major improvements to layout analysis for better image detection, diacritic detection, better textline finding, better tabstop finding.
  * Improved line detection and removal.
  * Added fixed pitch chopper for CJK.
  * Added UNICHARSET to WERD_CHOICE to make mult-language handling easier.
  * Fixed problems with internally scaled images.
  * Added page and bbox to string in tr files to identify source of training data better.
  * Fixes to Hindi Shiroreka splitter.
  * Added word bigram correction.
  * Reduced stack memory consumption and eliminated some ugly typedefs.
  * Added new uniform classifier API.
  * Added new training error counter.
  * Fixed endian bug in dawg reader.
  * Many other fixes, including the way in which the chopper finds chops and messes with the outline while it does so.

2010-11-29 - V3.01
  * Removed old/dead serialise/deserialze methods on *LISTIZED classes.
  * Total rewrite of DENORM to better encapsulate operation and make
    for potential to extract features from images.
  * Thread-safety! Moved all critical globals and statics to members of the appropriate class. Tesseract is now thread-safe (multiple instances can be used in parallel in multiple threads.) with the minor exception that some control parameters are still global and affect all threads.
  * Added Cube, a new recognizer for Arabic. Cube can also be used in combination with normal Tesseract for other languages with an improvement in accuracy at the cost of (much) lower speed. *There is no training module for Cube yet.*
  * `OcrEngineMode` in `Init` replaces `AccuracyVSpeed` to control cube.
  * Greatly improved segmentation search with consequent accuracy and speed improvements, especially for Chinese.
  * Added `PageIterator` and `ResultIterator` as cleaner ways to get the full results out of Tesseract, that are not currently provided by any of the `TessBaseAPI::Get*` methods. All other methods, such as the `ETEXT_STRUCT` in particular are deprecated and will be deleted in the future.
  * ApplyBoxes totally rewritten to make training easier. It can now cope with touching/overlapping training characters, and a new boxfile format allows word boxes instead of character boxes, BUT to use that you have to have already boostrapped the language with character boxes. "Cyclic dependency" on traineddata.
  * Auto orientation and script detection added to page layout analysis.
  * Deleted *lots* of dead code.
  * Fixxht module replaced with scalable data-driven module.
  * Output font characteristics accuracy improved.
  * Removed the double conversion at each classification.
  * Upgraded oldest structs to be classes and deprecated PBLOB.
  * Removed non-deterministic baseline fit.
  * Added fixed length dawgs for Chinese.
  * Handling of vertical text improved.
  * Handling of leader dots improved.
  * Table detection greatly improved.
  * Fixed a couple of memory leaks.
  * Fixed font labels on output text. (Not perfect, but a lot better than before.)
  * Cleanup and more bug fixes
  * Special treatments for Hindi.
  * Support for build in VS2010 with Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 (thanks to Michael Lutz)

2010-09-21 - V3.00

     * Changed TessBaseAPI methods to be non-static
     * Created a class hierarchy for the directories to hold instance data,
       and began moving code into the classes.
     * Moved thresholding code to a separate class.
  * Added major new page layout analysis module.
  * Added HOCR output (issues 221, 263: thanks to amkryukov).
  * Added Leptonica as main image I/O and handling. Currently optional,
    but in future releases linking with Leptonica will be mandatory.
  * Ambiguity table rewritten to allow definite replacements in place
    of fix_quotes.
  * Added TessdataManager to combine data files into a single file.
  * Some dead code deleted.
  * VC++6 no longer supported. It can't cope with the use of templates.
  * Many more languages added. 
  * Doxygenation of most of the function header comments.
  * Added man pages.
  * Added bash completion script (issue 247: thanks to neskiem)
  * Fix integer overview in thresholding (issue 366: thanks to Cyanide.Drake)
  * Add Danish Fraktur support (issues 300, 360: thanks to 
    dsl602230@vip.cybercity.dk)
  * Fix file pointer leak (issue 359, thanks to yukihiro.nakadaira)
  * Fix an error using user-words (Issue 345: thanks to max.markin)
  * Fix a memory leak in tablefind.cpp (Issue 342, thanks to zdravco)
  * Fix a segfault due to double fclose (Issue 320, thanks to souther)
  * Fix an automake error (Issue 318, thanks to ichanjz)
  * Fix a Win32 crash on fileFormatIsTiff() (Issues 304, 316, 317, 330, 347,
    349, 352: thanks to nguyenq87, max.markin, zdenop)
  * Fixed a number of errors in newer (stricter) versions of VC++ (Issues 
    301, among others)
