/**
 * The `node:diagnostics_channel` module provides an API to create named channels
 * to report arbitrary message data for diagnostics purposes.
 *
 * It can be accessed using:
 *
 * ```js
 * import diagnostics_channel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';
 * ```
 *
 * It is intended that a module writer wanting to report diagnostics messages
 * will create one or many top-level channels to report messages through.
 * Channels may also be acquired at runtime but it is not encouraged
 * due to the additional overhead of doing so. Channels may be exported for
 * convenience, but as long as the name is known it can be acquired anywhere.
 *
 * If you intend for your module to produce diagnostics data for others to
 * consume it is recommended that you include documentation of what named
 * channels are used along with the shape of the message data. Channel names
 * should generally include the module name to avoid collisions with data from
 * other modules.
 * @since v15.1.0, v14.17.0
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.x/lib/diagnostics_channel.js)

         * Trace a callback-receiving function call. This will always produce a `start event` and `end event` around the synchronous portion of the
         * function execution, and will produce a `asyncStart event` and `asyncEnd event` around the callback execution. It may also produce an `error event` if the given function throws an error or
         * the returned
         * promise rejects. This will run the given function using `channel.runStores(context, ...)` on the `start` channel which ensures all
         * events should have any bound stores set to match this trace context.
         *
         * The `position` will be -1 by default to indicate the final argument should
         * be used as the callback.
         *
         * ```js
         * import diagnostics_channel from 'node:diagnostics_channel';
         *
         * const channels = diagnostics_channel.tracingChannel('my-channel');
         *
         * channels.traceCallback((arg1, callback) => {
         *   // Do something
         *   callback(null, 'result');
         * }, 1, {
         *   some: 'thing',
         * }, thisArg, arg1, callback);
         * ```
         *
         * The callback will also be run with `channel.runStores(context, ...)` which
         * enables context loss recovery in some cases.
         *
         * To ensure only correct trace graphs are formed, events will only be published if subscribers are present prior to starting the trace. Subscriptions
         * which are added after the trace begins will not receive future events from that trace, only future traces will be seen.
         *
