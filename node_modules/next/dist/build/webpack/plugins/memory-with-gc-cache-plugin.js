This plugin is based on the internal one in webpack but heavily modified to use a different caching heuristic.

The change in this plugin compared to the built-in one in webpack is that this plugin always cleans up after 5 compilations.
The built-in plugin only cleans up "total modules / max generations".
The default for max generations is 5, so 1/5th of the modules would be marked for deletion.
This plugin instead always checks the cache and decreases the time to live of all entries. That way memory is cleaned up earlier.
